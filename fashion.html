<h4>The Victoria&#146s Secret ad "The Perfect Body" posted around September 12,2015 shows light skin girls that are possiable size 0 with 
big letters going across the picture saying "The Perfect Body". If I walked by this in the mall I&#146d feel like I&#146m not skinny enough
....Like I&#146m not that "Perfect body".</h4>

article </a> by daily mail there was a comment section with multiple comments like the one above...Yes there were positive comments. But there was multiple comments of people 
putting other people down...Why should it matter how much you weigh? Why should it matter if the color of your skin is different?... IT SHOULDN&#146T. 
The way you look shouldn&#146t matter. </p>

<p> Brandy Melville a female cothling company put these signs up around there stories saying <q>One size fits most</q>. 
Normally the sign/tag says one size fits ALL but they decited to put tags and signs saying one size fits MOST. This sign is 
basiclly saying there is a <q>norm</q> and some people don't fit that <q>norm</q>. </p>
